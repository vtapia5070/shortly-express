#shortly-express
This is a web application that saves and shortens urls, while updating the number of time a user visits that website.

The client is created using Backbone.js and Handlebars.js.

The server is created using Node/Express, Bookshelf.js ORM, SQLite, EJS templating, and Passport authentication.

This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).
